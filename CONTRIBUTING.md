# Contributing to Homeworkplanner

Thanks for considering taking the time to contribute to this homeworkplanner :thumbsup:. In this file you will find some guidelines on
contributing to this project.

## Code of Conduct
This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/nobobo1234/homeworkplanner/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in this repository. 
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## My goals
My goal for this project is to develop a fully functional system that...
- Organizes your homework and classes.
- Organizes your grades.
- Is easy and simple to use.
- Automatically plans in homework for you so you don't have to do it
- Organizes the general tasks in your life, e.g. playing football or doing the dishes

## How to report a bug
_TODO_

## Javascript Style Guide
We use the [Airbnb Base Styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb-base) as our leading styleguide with some minor overwrites, namely:
- We allow to omit the parens if you write an arrow function with one parameter, for example, the following piece of code is allowed:
```js
const a = b => console.log(b)
```
- We allow `for ... of ...` statements because sometimes `for ... of ...` loops look much better than standard array iterations.

## Where can I ask for help
_TODO_

## A note about packages
We try to keep external packages to a minimum and write the CSS mostly ourselves, if possible. Only packages that are not easily
coded ourselves can be added. Please contact me if you are doubting about adding a certain package.

## Do I get any recognition?
Yes you do! We follow the [all contributors](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors) spec. If you make any kind of contribution to this project you will be noted.

Yours sincerely,
Noah van Boven
